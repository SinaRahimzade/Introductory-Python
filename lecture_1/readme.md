# Python Overview

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

### Python Is a Full-Spectrum Language
When learning a new programming language, you don’t yet have the experience to judge how well it will serve you in the long run. If you are considering Python, let me assure you that this is a good choice. One key reason is that Python is a full-spectrum language.

What do I mean by this? Some languages are very good for beginners. They hold your hand and make programming super easy. We can go to the extreme and look at visual languages such as Scratch.

Here you get blocks that represent programming concepts, like variables, loops, method calls, and so on, and you drag and drop them on a visual surface. Scratch may be easy to get started with for simple programs, But you cannot build professional applications with it.

Other languages are incredibly powerful for expert developers. The most popular one in this category is likely C++ and its close relative C. Whatever web browser you used today was likely written in C or C++. Your operating system running that browser was also very likely built with C/C++. Your favorite first-person shooter or strategy video game? You nailed it: C/C++.

Both Scratch and C++ are decidedly not what I would call full- spectrum languages. In the Scratch level, it’s easy to start but you have to switch to a “real” language to build real applications. Conversely, you can build real apps with C++, yet there is no gentle on-ramp. You dive head first into all the complexity of that language which exists to support these rich applications.

Python, on the other hand, is special. It is a full-spectrum language. We often judge the simplicity of a language based on the “hello world” test. That is, what syntax and actions are necessary to get that lan- guage to output “hello world” to the user? In Python, it couldn’t be simpler:
```python 
print('hello world')
```

# Selection Sort
Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is an in-place comparison-based algorithm in which the list is divided into two parts, the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end. Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire list. in each iteration of the selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted sub-list is picked and moved to the sorted sub-list.

## Algorithm
1. Find the minimum element in the array.
2. Swap the minimum element with the first element of the array.
3. Find the second minimum element in the array.
4. Swap the second minimum element with the second element of the array.
5. go on doing this until the last element of the array.
6. end

# Insertion Sort 
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.

## Algorithm
1. Iterate from arr[1] to arr[n] over the array.
2. for each element arr[i], compare it with the elements on the left of it and swap it with the left element if it is smaller than the left element.
3. end
